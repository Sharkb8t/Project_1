Tools:

  2.) NumbPy
  3.) MatPlotLib
  4.) Jupyter NoteBook

Function:
    This program generates data graphics for median income & voter turnout data from the years 2016 and 2020, for comparison. This comparison is both broad as well as specific to the demographic metrics of ethnicity, age, and household type.
    We imported CSVs that we manually generated however they were composed of data originally collected from: 
    https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-273.html
    https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/voting-and-registration/p20-580.html

    The graphics this program generates are formatted as double bar graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots. These formats were chosen to allow to boths years data to be compared on the same figure.
